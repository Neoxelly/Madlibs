# Madlibs
A simple Madlibs/Word Blanks project made in C++ to be played in the terminal. 

NOTE: The project is not yet finished, I just started working on it.

ANOTHER NOTE: If you're reading this, it means that on some stories the input doesn't work as it should. I am in the process of fixing that, so don't worry!
# How to run
After installing it, open the folder and find main.exe. Enjoy!
