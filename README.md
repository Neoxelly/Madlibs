# Madlibs
A simple Madlibs/Word Blanks project made in C++ to be played in the terminal. 

NOTE: The project is not yet finished, I just started working on it.

ANOTHER NOTE: While playing, do not input more than one word (For example "Bus Station") because it confuses the programme and makes it skip the next lines you have to input.
# How to run
After installing it, open the folder and find main.exe. Enjoy!
