# Madlibs
A simple Madlibs/Word Blanks project made in C++ to be played in the terminal. 

NOTE: The project is not yet finished, I am working on it as a side project.

# How to play
- After installing it, open the terminal, find the location where the file is in and open main.exe
- Or open the folder and enjoy!
